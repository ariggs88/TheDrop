<h1 style="font-color: blue; font-family: Garamond">The Drop</h1>
The Drop is a <span style="font-style: bold">Glorified</span> folder for your desktop.  It still needs a little bit of work but it is fully functional.  Drag and Drop all of your favorite files and folders into The Drop and clear the clutter on your desktop.  

<h3>Customize Everything</h3>
<p>
  Customize everything from font size to font color and even add your own background image.  There are predefined themes provided in the drop.  All your favorite colors, red, yellow, orange, purple, green, blue, dark and light.  In the future the drop will provide you with the option to create your own theme; name it and save it.  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drop was coded in C# and could use some sprucing up.  Getting rid of some of the repetitive code is in the works.  This program is useful if you have tons of folders on your desktop and want to clear the clutter.  If anyone wants to add on by all means be my guest and please send a copy back I would enjoy seeing what you guys have in mind.
